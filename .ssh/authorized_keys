command="/home/dns-update/update-client foobar",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa <LONG_KEY> comment for key on host foobar

TODOs:

- of course, remove all this text ;-)
- add a line for every client host
- change the hostname for every client host (`foobar' inside the example command string)
- add the real public key instead of `<LONG_KEY>' for every client host (change `ssh-rsa' as needed)
- change the comment as you see fit
