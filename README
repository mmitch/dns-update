HOW TO INSTALL ON THE SERVER
============================

1. Install a nameserver of your choice and serve a zone dedicated to your dynamical IPs.
   You propably need a delegation for that zone from somewhere else.
   All this is NOT handled in this howto.

   My setup works with nsd3 as nameserver but apart from "please reload the zonefile"
   there is no interaction with the nameserver, so it should be easily portable.


2. Create a new user for the sole purpose of handling the dynamic DNS updates.
   This user needs a normal shell (/bin/sh should be enough - with /bin/false, the
   SSH forced commands won't runâ€¦), a home directory and SSH access (be sure to include
   him in AllowUsers/AllowGroups of you use them to restrict access via SSH).
   The password of the user can and should be disabled (either after configuration is
   finished or you'll have to use su(1) while configuring stuff).

   This repository is configured for a user `dns-update' with a home directory of
   /home/dns-update



  [...]
 


x. Clone this git repository RIGHT INTO the home directory of the dedicated user.
   Log in as or su(1) to the user and do `git clone $SOMEWHERE /home/dns-update'


y. Create a local branch (`git checkout -b local').  Do your local configuration:

   * edit `.ssh/authorized_keys' (see notes in file)
   * edit $ZONEFILE to your zone file name in `generate-zone'

   Check in your changes (`git commit -a').


z. Basically, you're ready to go now!


HOW TO UPDATE THE SERVER
========================

1. Log in/su to user dns-update.

2. Switch git branch back to master (be sure to have no pending local changes):
   $ git checkout master

3. Get updates:
   $ get pull

4. Switch back to your local branch:
   $ git checkout local

5. Merge the updates.  You might have to solve merge conflicts, be ready for that:
   $ git merge master
